# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kalakar AI Artisan Marketplace application currently has a React frontend with simulated API calls and incomplete functionality. The voice capture feature should be redesigned as an interactive conversation where the AI asks follow-up questions to gather comprehensive product information. Before making it production-ready, we need to fix the core application functionality by implementing real API integrations, completing broken features, and ensuring the entire user flow works end-to-end.

## Requirements

3. WHEN the AI asks questions THEN it SHALL use text-to-speech to speak the questions in my selected language
4. WHEN I respond to questions THEN the system SHALL capture and process each response
5. WHEN the conversation progresses THEN the AI SHALL ask about materials, size, colors, crafting process, cultural significance, and pricing
6. WHEN I provide incomplete information THEN the AI SHALL ask clarifying questions to gather missing details
7. WHEN the conversation is complete THEN the AI SHALL summarize all gathered information for my confirmation
8. WHEN I confirm the summary THEN the system SHALL proceed to photo upload
9. The AI Shall use Gemini Live for this

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN I seem uncertain THEN the AI SHALL provide examples or suggestions to help me respond
6. WHEN I give short answers THEN the AI SHALL encourage me to provide more detail

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the photo upload functionality to work completely, so that I can upload and manage my product photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select photos THEN they SHALL be uploaded and displayed as previews
2. WHEN photos are uploaded THEN they SHALL be validated for type, size, and quality
3. WHEN I want to remove a photo THEN I SHALL be able to delete it from the upload list
4. WHEN I have uploaded photos THEN I SHALL be able to reorder them
5. WHEN photos are processed THEN they SHALL be optimized for web display
6. WHEN upload fails THEN I SHALL see specific error messages and retry options
7. The AI Shall use Gemini Nano Banana for this

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real AI-powered listing generation, so that I get actual product listings based on my conversational input and photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete the conversation and photo upload THEN the system SHALL call real Gemini AI APIs
2. WHEN AI processes my data THEN it SHALL generate a complete product listing using all conversational details
3. WHEN listing is generated THEN it SHALL include artisan bio information based on my profile and conversation
4. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the listing SHALL incorporate cultural significance and crafting details from conversation
5. WHEN generation fails THEN I SHALL be able to retry with clear error messaging
6. WHEN I'm not satisfied THEN I SHALL be able to regenerate the listing or restart the conversation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want working marketplace export functionality, so that I can actually export my listings to Etsy, Amazon, and WhatsApp Business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose to export to Etsy THEN the system SHALL format and send the listing using Etsy's API
2. WHEN I choose to export to Amazon THEN the system SHALL format the listing for Amazon's requirements
3. WHEN I choose WhatsApp Business THEN the system SHALL create a shareable message format

6. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN I SHALL see appropriate error handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the complete user flow to work seamlessly, so that I can go from conversation to exported listing without errors.

2. WHEN the AI is thinking THEN progress indicators SHALL show conversation status
3. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN users SHALL see clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN network is unavailable THEN offline messaging SHALL be shown with conversation state preserved
5. WHEN retries are possible THEN retry buttons SHALL be provided without losing conversation context
